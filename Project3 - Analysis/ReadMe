To use cloud computing instead of building its own infrastructure. 
There is concensus that a cloud computing software stack at the layer of IaaS will be used, 
but its not clear whether the computing resources should be rented from a public cloud on-demand, 
or whether a private cloud should be purchased. You are tasked to find the cost breakdown of a private cloud, 
and compare that to what Amazon would charge.

Cost of different configurations for 3 different set of requirements.
Configuration 1: Hadoop/Spark Cluster
Configuration 2: Support 1 million virtual machines
Configuration 3: Support deep learning with 1 exaflop of mixed precision performance
